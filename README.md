I am a drug safety specialist level 2 data analyst professional with deep experience in pharmacovigilance company in data analysis and visualization field. 
My strengths include working and growing with team, developing reports quaterly, semi yearly and yearly using technical skills such as Excel, mySQL, Tableau and powerBI. 
I have achieved impactful role in decision making, leading to an improvement in report generation speed by 25% and several award winning like best quality analyst, best trainer.
I am interested in continuous growth and expanding my scope in data analytics is other domains too like insurance and banking in my next role.

It was an unfortunate experience I had in my life time of getting lay off, though it was not due to performance based but losing project since market recently encountered 
other small scale competetors attracting clients by bidding same work in less cost, which ultimately lead to losing of 2 projects by now from syneos and 
impacted on jobs of over 300+ employees including management level personnels senior analysts and junior employees too. 
Though I was feeling stagnant in the job responsibilities I was delivering on table also a unfortunate situation of lay offs striked as an accident in my life 
I have accepted it as a chance to explore new opportunities in current market and I've been able to learn new skills of key technologies in data analytics and 
visualization which brought me to you. In syneos, I was working on reconciliation, tracking quality metrics, visualization with presentations to client and 
along with core responsibilities which was a impactful role and thus I was released in the last week complete transition. 
Last and current year for syneos was too challenging after losing two projects, many great people were let go which are even in my contact today helping eachother 
for getting placement.
